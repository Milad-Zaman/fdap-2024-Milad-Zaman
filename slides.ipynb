    "2. Two case studies on current topics in data science and financial economics (individually)\n",

Please note that the discussion board is monitored and should be used strictly for Q&A that relates to the class. \"How do you like the food in the dining hall?\" is not considered a relevant question, hence, does not get you any points. You are allowed to cite and link external sources (e.g. Stack Overflow). You can add an additional answer (there is a voting system).\n",
