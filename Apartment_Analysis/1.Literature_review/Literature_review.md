## Factors Affecting the Price of Residential Properties in Urban Areas
### Determinants of Real Estate Prices
Recent studies have analyzed the determinants of real estate prices in Germany using regional panel data. Significant factors influencing housing prices include both supply-side and demand-side variables. On the supply side, construction activity and housing stock are critical (Belke & Keil, 2018). Demand-side factors encompass economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, exchange rates, and interest rates (Alkali et al., 2018). Demographic factors, including population growth and age structure, also play a vital role (Belke & Keil, 2018; Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). Multiple studies have found a positive relationship between apartment size and price (Ndegwa, 2018; Engerstam et al., 2020; Drafor Amenyah & Fletcher, 2013). Additionally, wages, migration patterns, and the productive structure of cities contribute to price formation (Taltavull de La Paz, 2003), while the money supply and financial sector dynamics also impact real estate markets (Makena, 2012).

### Location and Accessibility
Location and accessibility to employment are significant determinants of residential property prices. Proximity to highways and public transit generally increases property values (Haider & Miller, 2000; Iacono & Levinson, 2011). However, being too close to highways can negatively impact prices (Iacono & Levinson, 2011). Neighborhood characteristics, such as average household income and local educational quality, play a crucial role (Haider & Miller, 2000; Iacono & Levinson, 2011). Urban amenities, including proximity to beaches, rivers, and parks, significantly appreciate property values, while factors like crime rates and proximity to low-income areas can depreciate them (Fernández-Durán et al., 2011; Seabra & Silveira Neto, 2016).

### Analytical Tools and Methodologies
Various analytical tools are employed to capture the complex relationships between these factors. Spatial autoregressive models and artificial neural networks are commonly used (Haider & Miller, 2000; Fernández-Durán et al., 2011). For instance, Fernández-Durán et al. (2011) used artificial neural networks to quantify the effects of accessibility, public utilities, and urban planning on housing prices in Valencia, Spain. Fik et al. (2003) proposed an interactive variables approach, emphasizing the interplay between location and other value determinants. Haider and Miller (2000) found that transportation infrastructure and location were not strong determinants when other variables were considered in Toronto. Ruan et al. (2022) applied spatial data-driven methods in Hangzhou, China, revealing that schools and subway stations had the most significant positive impact on house prices, while hospitals and business centers had negative effects.

## Factors in Online Platforms
### Determinants of Rental Prices on Online Platforms
Online platforms for rental housing searches have become increasingly important, influencing pricing and market dynamics. Property characteristics, including facilities and services offered, are significant determinants (Zhang et al., 2019). Location plays a crucial role, with spatial factors like proximity to roads and land value impacting prices (Kimani et al., 2021).Recent studies have explored factors influencing apartment rental duration and vacancy. Key determinants include price, size, and location, with proximity to amenities like schools and bakeries playing a significant role (Marcelo Del Cajias & Freudenreich, 2023). Socioeconomic measures and neighborhood composition also influence listing representation across platforms (Hess et al., 2021). Transaction conditions and convenience can affect pricing (Zhang et al., 2019). Geographically weighted regression models have shown better performance than ordinary least squares in analyzing price determinants, revealing spatial variability in their effects (Suárez-Vega & Hernández, 2020).

### Influence of Visual and Textual Elements
Research on online rental platforms suggests that visual elements significantly influence consumer decision-making. High-quality listing photos, particularly those taken by professionals, can enhance booking likelihood (Wu et al., 2021). However, color richness in images negatively affects both booking decisions and tenant satisfaction, while household and leisure content positively impacts bookings (Yang & Tian, 2022). Host photos also play a crucial role, with perceived trustworthiness from these images affecting listing prices and booking probabilities more than review scores (Ert et al., 2016). A discrepancy often exists between directly declared housing quality and that indirectly signaled through photos (Hebdzyński, 2023). Textual descriptions processed using machine learning algorithms show varying degrees of consistency with visual quality signals, with agreement rates ranging from 63-90% for sales listings and 71-83% for rentals (Hebdzyński, 2023). Analysis of Munich's rental market shows that listing duration has decreased annually, with apartments in the city center having shorter listing periods compared to those in peripheral areas (Kaller, 2019). Factors such as price per square meter, number of rooms, and floor level also influence listing duration (Kaller, 2019).


In conclusion, these studies highlight the complex and dynamic nature of real estate markets, indicating that different approaches to understanding and predicting the value of residential real estate in urban environments can be adopted depending on a research problem.
