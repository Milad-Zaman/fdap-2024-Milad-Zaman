## Factors affecting the price of residential properties in urban areas


Recent studies have examined the determinants of real estate prices in Germany using regional panel data. Key factors influencing housing prices include supply-side variables like construction activity and housing stock, as well as demand-side factors such as rents, market size, age structure, and local infrastructure (Belke & Keil, 2018). Demand-side factors include economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, exchange rates, and interest rates (Alkali et al., 2018), as well as demographic factors like population growth and age structure (Belke & Keil, 2018; Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). Local market characteristics, including apartment rents, market size, and infrastructure, also influence prices (Belke & Keil, 2018). Additionally, factors such as wages, migration patterns, and the productive structure of cities contribute to price formation (Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). The money supply and financial sector dynamics play a role in shaping real estate markets (Makena, 2012).


Location and accessibility to employment are significant determinants, with proximity to highways and public transit generally increasing property values (Haider & Miller, 2000; Iacono & Levinson, 2011). However, being too close to highways can negatively impact prices (Iacono & Levinson, 2011). Neighborhood characteristics, such as average household income and local educational quality, also play a crucial role (Haider & Miller, 2000; Iacono & Levinson, 2011). Urban amenities, including proximity to beaches, rivers, and parks, can significantly appreciate property values, while factors like crime rates and proximity to low-income areas can depreciate them (Fernández-Durán et al., 2011; Seabra & Silveira Neto, 2016). The studies employ various analytical tools, including spatial autoregressive models and artificial neural networks, to capture these complex relationships (Haider & Miller, 2000; Fernández-Durán et al., 2011).


Fernández-Durán et al. (2011) employed artificial neural networks to quantify the effects of accessibility, public utilities, and urban planning on housing prices in Valencia, Spain. Fik et al. (2003) proposed an interactive variables approach, emphasizing that location interacts with other value determinants and cannot be treated as a separate factor. Haider and Miller (2000) utilized spatial autoregressive models to assess the influence of transportation infrastructure and location on housing values in Toronto, finding that these factors were not strong determinants when other variables were considered. Ruan et al. (2022) applied spatial data-driven methods in Hangzhou, China, revealing that schools and subway stations had the most significant positive impact on house prices, while hospitals and business centers had negative effects. These studies collectively highlight the complex relationship between location and residential real estate prices in urban settings.

## Factors in Online Platforms

Online platforms for rental housing searches have become increasingly important, influencing pricing and market dynamics. Several factors affect rental prices on these platforms. Property characteristics, including facilities and services offered, are significant determinants (Zhang et al., 2019). Location plays a crucial role, with spatial factors like proximity to roads and land value impacting prices (Kimani et al., 2021). Socioeconomic measures and neighborhood composition also influence listing representation across platforms (Hess et al., 2021). Transaction conditions and convenience can affect pricing (Zhang et al., 2019). Interestingly, traditional hotel pricing factors may not always apply to shared accommodations (Zhang et al., 2019). Geographically weighted regression models have shown better performance than ordinary least squares in analyzing price determinants, revealing how their effects vary spatially (Suárez-Vega & Hernández, 2020).


Research on online rental platforms suggests that visual elements significantly influence consumer decision-making. High-quality listing photos, particularly those taken by professionals, can enhance booking likelihood (Wu et al., 2021). However, color richness in images negatively affects both booking decisions and tenant satisfaction, while household and leisure content positively impacts bookings (Yang & Tian, 2022). Host photos also play a crucial role, with perceived trustworthiness from these images affecting listing prices and booking probabilities more than review scores (Ert et al., 2016). Interestingly, there often exists a discrepancy between directly declared housing quality and that indirectly signaled through photos (Hebdzyński, 2023). Textual descriptions processed using machine learning algorithms show varying degrees of consistency with visual quality signals, with agreement rates ranging from 63-90% for sales listings and 71-83% for rentals (Hebdzyński, 2023). Analysis of Munich's rental market shows that listing duration has decreased annually, with apartments in the city center having shorter listing periods compared to those in peripheral areas (Kaller, 2019). Factors such as price per square meter, number of rooms, and floor level also influence listing duration (Kaller, 2019).
