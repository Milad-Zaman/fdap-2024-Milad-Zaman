## Factors affecting the price of residential properties in urban areas
<div style="text-align: justify;">

The determinants of residential real estate prices in urban areas are multifaceted, encompassing both supply and demand factors. On the supply side, construction activity, housing stock, and land availability play crucial roles (Belke & Keil, 2018; Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). Demand-side factors include economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, exchange rates, and interest rates (Alkali et al., 2018), as well as demographic factors like population growth and age structure (Belke & Keil, 2018; Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). Local market characteristics, including apartment rents, market size, and infrastructure, also influence prices (Belke & Keil, 2018). Additionally, factors such as wages, migration patterns, and the productive structure of cities contribute to price formation (Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). The money supply and financial sector dynamics play a role in shaping real estate markets (Makena, 2012).

Location and accessibility to employment are significant determinants, with proximity to highways and public transit generally increasing property values (Haider & Miller, 2000; Iacono & Levinson, 2011). However, being too close to highways can negatively impact prices (Iacono & Levinson, 2011). Neighborhood characteristics, such as average household income and local educational quality, also play a crucial role (Haider & Miller, 2000; Iacono & Levinson, 2011). Urban amenities, including proximity to beaches, rivers, and parks, can significantly appreciate property values, while factors like crime rates and proximity to low-income areas can depreciate them (Fernández-Durán et al., 2011; Seabra & Silveira Neto, 2016). The studies employ various analytical tools, including spatial autoregressive models and artificial neural networks, to capture these complex relationships (Haider & Miller, 2000; Fernández-Durán et al., 2011).

Fernández-Durán et al. (2011) employed artificial neural networks to quantify the effects of accessibility, public utilities, and urban planning on housing prices in Valencia, Spain. Fik et al. (2003) proposed an interactive variables approach, emphasizing that location interacts with other value determinants and cannot be treated as a separate factor. Haider and Miller (2000) utilized spatial autoregressive models to assess the influence of transportation infrastructure and location on housing values in Toronto, finding that these factors were not strong determinants when other variables were considered. Ruan et al. (2022) applied spatial data-driven methods in Hangzhou, China, revealing that schools and subway stations had the most significant positive impact on house prices, while hospitals and business centers had negative effects. These studies collectively highlight the complex relationship between location and residential real estate prices in urban settings.
