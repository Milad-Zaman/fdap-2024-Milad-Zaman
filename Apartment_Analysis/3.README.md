# Guidance of Codes and Data

## Web scraping
The **Scraper.py** is my codes for web scraping from the website of WG-gesucht. I wanted to collect data of price, size of the room(size), availability, apartment size and number of rooms(rooms) from ADs in Hamburg.I used Inspect in the website and found the specific address for each variables. With a function, my code can extract data of the variables from an Ad. Web scraping start from the first page of searching WGs and apartments in Hamburg and collect the data of all Ads in the page, then I repited this process page by page until page 24 because after 4 or 5 pages the website did not allowe me to scrap the data. Also I changed my source of the internt from my wifi to my cell phone several times in order to avoid this problem. Finally, I managed to collect the data from WG-gesucht and the *excel file of raw data* is **wg_gesucht_ads.xlsx**
