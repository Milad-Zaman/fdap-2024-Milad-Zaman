# Factors affecting the price of residential properties in urban areas

The determinants of residential real estate prices in urban areas are multifaceted, encompassing both supply and demand factors. On the supply side, construction activity, housing stock, and land availability play crucial roles (Belke & Keil, 2018; Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). Demand-side factors include economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, exchange rates, and interest rates (Alkali et al., 2018), as well as demographic factors like population growth and age structure (Belke & Keil, 2018; Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). Local market characteristics, including apartment rents, market size, and infrastructure, also influence prices (Belke & Keil, 2018). Additionally, factors such as wages, migration patterns, and the productive structure of cities contribute to price formation (Taltavull de La Paz, 2003). The money supply and financial sector dynamics play a role in shaping real estate markets (Makena, 2012).
