## Course Description

This course is designed to provide students with a hands-on understanding of the use of data science techniques in the field of finance. Students will learn how to collect, clean, and analyze financial data using Python, SQL and other tools. Topics will include financial data visualization, time series analysis and statistical modeling. Students will work on real-world projects to apply their knowledge to financial data.

## Prerequisites

* Strong interest and pre-knowledge in financial economics
* Basic knowledge of programming (preferably Python) and statistics
* All the software used during this course are open-source and/or free, this includes:
    * Python (Anaconda distribution): https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
    * Git: https://git-scm.com/
    * GitHub: https://skills.github.com/

As a backup, instead of opening .ipynb files locally, you can open the slides
* using [**Google's Colab HERE**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cafawo/FinancialDataAnalytics/blob/master/slides.ipynb).
* or as a static (offline) [html version HERE](https://cafawo.github.io/FinancialDataAnalytics/slides.html).


This course is predominantly hands on and draws from several subject areas, such as financial economics, data science or textual analysis. As such, there exists no single text book recommendation. Relevant 'reading' material is linked in the script. That being said, resources include but are not limited to:
* "Python for Finance" (Yves Hilpisch)
* "Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy" (Gabor Bekes, Gabor Kezdi)
* "Applied Text Analysis with Python" (Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Tony Ojeda)
* "The big short" (A. McKay)
* "Margin Call" (J. C. Chandor)
* https://stackoverflow.com/
* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html


## Grading Policy

The grading policy is discussed in detail during the first lecture.

* Homework assignments: 20%
* Case studies: 50%
* Presentation: 30%
* Bonus points: + 15%
  * Participation in GitHub discussions: https://github.com/cafawo/FinancialDataAnalytics/discussions
  * Bug bounty (pull requests): https://github.com/cafawo/FinancialDataAnalytics/pulls

All students are requested to hand in their homework, cases and presentation slides as one Git repository. We will discuss this during the first lecture.
